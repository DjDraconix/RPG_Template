# RPG_Template
## Synopsis
This is a battle simpulator that allow a user to pick between three classes and then pick an enemy to fight.
## Motivation
I wanted to remake a vertion of my old code that can be expanded opon so there can be more classes for the player and more enemyies to fight.
## How to Run
Take all files labled with .java and onpe in any text editor you would like. Then navigate to BattleGround.java and execute the code from there.
## Tests
When you click start it will ask you to pick a class then pick a creature. Then it follows like a tern based RPG.
